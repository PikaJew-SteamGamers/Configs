// Note that you only need to include weapons that actually do something in entwatch files. random weapon_* entities around the map simply placed for player pickup but not actually a map powerup or needed to advance somewhere don't need to be included here.

"entities" {
	"0" {						// This is the number of the powerup. If you have more than 1 powerup in a map, copy everything in this block and add 1 to the number (see examples under for how this should go up.) Always start numbers at 0 and go up by 1 each time
		"name"              "" 			// This is the full name of the powerup. It is also what will appear in chat on pickup/use/death/drop.
		"shortname"         "" 			// This is a shortened version of the powerup name. It appears in the hud, the scoreboad, and can be used to transfer via !etransfer $shortname user. Try to avoid putting spaces in the shortname to make it easier for admins to etransfer powerups.
		"color"             "" 			// This is a prefix added to the name when the powerup appears in chat. Common server colors include {} around them such as "{blue}" or "{red}". Note that these colors depend on server settings to work. This is an optional setting and can be left blank.
		"buttonclass"       "func_button" 	// This is how players interact with the powerup. Common instances are func_botton or func_rot_button. Find this by searching up the weapon's targetname in VIDE and finding which type of button has a parentname with the weapon's targetname 
		"filtername"        "" 			// This is what the weapon will set the targetname of the player that picked it up. Find this typically by looking at the weapon's OnPlayerPickup commands and find one that is "!activator AddOutput targetname <filter> 0 1" and set this to whatever that filter is.
		"hasfiltername"     "true" 		// true if you have something in the "filtername" setting, false if the "filtername" setting is blank.
		"blockpickup"       "false" 		// Leave false typically.  If true, players cannot pickup the powerup.
		"allowtransfer"     "true" 		// Allows admins to use !etransfer to transfer powerups between players. Typically leave as true, but you can set it to false on zombie powerups if you want.
		"forcedrop"         "true" 		// Forces the powerup to drop on player death. Leave true for human powers and false for zombie powers.
		"chat"              "true" 		// If true, makes a chat message show up when the powerup is picked up, dropped, the death of the player with it, or when it is used. (No chat trigger will appear for its uses if the setting "mode" is set to 0 or 1)
		"hud"               "true" 		// If true, will make the powerup appear in the hud menu and the scoreboard when picked up

		"mode"              "2" 		// 0 - no button. 1 - Spam protection. 2 - infinite uses with cooldowns. 3 - Limited uses with no cooldowns between uses. 4 - Limited uses with cooldowns between uses.
		"maxuses"           "0" 		// Leave as 0 if "mode" is set to 0, 1, or 2. If "mode" is 3 or 4, find max uses by looking at the button's OnPressed commands. If there is nothing with a counter there, check for a OnPressed command of "<filter> TestActivator 0 1", search for that filter in VIDE and see how it interacts with a counter or relay. Then, set this to the max value of the counter. If a powerup is 1 use, it will not use a counter and will instead have the button, filter, or relay simply lock the button and never unlock it.
		"cooldown"          "" 			// Set to 0 if "mode" is 0, 1, or 3. If "mode" is 2 or 4, find this by looking at either the "wait" parameter of the button in VIDE (this way is rarely used) or by finding how long the delay is until the button, filter, or relay runs an Unlock output on the button. (ie. a command of "OnTrigger" run with "powerup_buttonUnlock50-1" would have a 50 second cooldown)
		"maxamount"         "1" 		// Set to the max amount of multiple instances of this powerup can be spawned at the SAME time. Typically leave at 1. If 2 heal powers can spawn but have different hammerids, this will still be set at 1. Only increase this on certain maps like santassination that use a point_template to make multiples of the same powerup at the same time.
